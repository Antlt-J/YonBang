# YonBang  

[![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD--3--Clause-green "license")](LICENSE)

A simple implementation of YonBang on html page.  

YonBang is a variant of a classic game -- Gobang (a.k.a Gomoku or Renju). Unlike
Gobang, there are 3 players in this game. Players put stone on the board in turn 
according to order of *"black-white-cyan"*, and the first to get 4 straight stones 
in a line in either vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction will become the 
champion of this game. Remaining players can continue to play on the board using
the rules of classical Gobang game, that is to say, the player who gets 5 stones
in a line wins the second place. If the whole board is filled, the game draws.  

This game can only be played on desktop and neither supports online game nor AI 
at present because it is merely a practice of js language. Just have fun with 
your mates on one computer.
